    <em class="aree">(28 April 1937– 30 December 2006), known mononymously as Saddam, was an Iraqi politician and revolutionary who was the fifth president of Iraq,
         from 16 July 1979 until 9 April 2003. He also served as prime minister of Iraq,
          first from 16 July 1979 until 23 March 1991, and later from 29 May 1994 to 9 April 2003.
           He was a leading member of the revolutionary Arab Socialist Ba'ath Party, and later,
            the Baghdad-based Ba'ath Party and its regional organization, the Iraqi Ba'ath Party, which espoused Ba'athism,
         a mix of Arab nationalism and Arab socialism.</em>
         <h3 class="misba">Saddam was born in Al-Awja, near Tikrit, to a prominent Sunni Muslim family.
          He joined the Arab Socialist Ba'ath Party in 1957, and the Baghdad-based Ba'ath Party, and its regional organization
          , the Iraqi Ba'ath Party.</h3>
          <pre class="aree">He played a key role in the 17 July Revolution and was appointed vice president by Ahmed Hassan al-Bakr
          . Saddam nationalised the Iraq Petroleum Company, diversifying the Iraqi economy.
           He presided over the Second Iraqi–Kurdish War (1974–1975)</pre>
          <strong class="faree">Following al-Bakr's resignation in 1979, Saddam formally took power in 1979,
            although he had already been the de facto head of Iraq for several years.
          Positions of power in the country were mostly filled with Sunni Arabs,
           a minority that made up only a fifth of the population.[8]</strong>

           <strong class="fff">Saddam Hussein was born on 28 April 1937[a] in al-Awja
            , a small village near Tikrit to Hussein Abd Al-Majid and Subha Tulfah Al-Mussallat.
             They both were from the Albu Nasir tribe, a tribe that had descended from Ahmed Bin Hussein
              'Nasiruddin' who was a descendant of Imam Hussein Bin Ali. The Albu Nasir tribe had settled in Tikrit after migrating from Yemen.
              [12][13] Saddam's brother and father Hussein Abd al-Majid al-Tikriti both died of cancer before his birth.

  <h1><em>History of Afghanistan</em></h1>

<h2>The history of Afghanistan, preceding the establishment of the Emirate of Afghanistan
     in 1823 is shared with that of neighbouring Iran,
     central Asia and Indian subcontinent.
     The Sadozai monarchy ruled the Afghan Durrani Empire, considered the founding state of modern Afghanistan.[1]</h2>
     <em>Human habitation in Afghanistan dates back to the Middle Paleolithic era, and the country's
    strategic location along the historic Silk Road has led it to being described, picturesquely,
     as the ‘roundabout of the ancient world’.
     [2] The land has historically been home to various peoples and has witnessed numerous military campaigns
     including those by the Persians, Alexander the Great, the Maurya Empire, Arab Muslims, the Mongols,
            the British, the Soviet Union, and most recently by a US-led coalition.</em>
            <h3>[3] The various conquests and periods in both the Iranian and Indian cultural spheres[4][5]
            made the area a center for Zoroastrianism, Buddhism, Hinduism, and later Islam throughout history.[6]</h3>
            <hr>The Durrani Empire is considered to be the foundational polity of the modern nation-state of Afghanistan,
              with Ahmad Shah Durrani being credited as its Father of the Nation.[7][8]
              However, Dost Mohammad Khan is generally considered to be the founder of the first modern Afghan
              <pre>Shah, it was divided into multiple smaller independent kingdoms, including but not limited to Herat
                , Kandahar and Kabul.</pre>

                 <hr> and Afghanistan was consequently thrown back into civil war with fighting amongst his successors.
                 During this time, Afghanistan became a buffer state in the Great Game between the British Empire
                  (in British-ruled India) and the Russian Empire. From India, the British attempted to subjugate
                  Afghanistan but were repelled in the First Anglo-Afghan War. However, the Second Anglo-Afghan
                 War saw a British victory and the successful establishment of British political influence over Afghanistan.
                  Following the Third Anglo-Afghan War in 1919, Afghanistan became free of foreign political hegemony,
                 and emerged as the independent Kingdom of Afghanistan in June 1926 under Amanullah Khan.
                 <p>This monarchy lasted almost half a century,
                 until Zahir Shah was overthrown in 1973, following which the Republic of Afghanistan was established.</p>
